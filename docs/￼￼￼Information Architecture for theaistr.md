Page‑by‑Page Structure and Content
1. Home
Hero section
Headline: “AI that works for small and medium businesses.” Explain that AI adoption has reached a tipping point for SMBs — over 50 % of small businesses are exploring AI and one‑quarter are already using it daily
newsroom.paypal-corp.com
. Note that 82 % think adopting AI is essential to stay competitive
newsroom.paypal-corp.com
.
Sub‑text: Many SMBs are overwhelmed by manual work — hunting for data, writing marketing copy, answering routine customer questions and reconciling reports. The AI Struggle Bus embeds AI agents into your existing tools so information gathers itself, work routes itself, and you get back to growth. Unlike feature vendors, we deliver workflows and outcomes, not another portal.
Primary CTA: Book an AI Assessment. Secondary CTA: Start a 30‑Day Value Sprint.
The Pain
Brief paragraph describing the everyday friction of running a small business: copying/pasting content, staying on top of orders and invoices, answering the same questions, and manually updating product pages. Highlight that only about one in four small businesses have fully integrated AI
newsroom.paypal-corp.com
, while over half are still exploring
newsroom.paypal-corp.com
 and need clear ROI and easy‑to‑use tools
newsroom.paypal-corp.com
.
What We Do
Explain that the AI Struggle Bus automates internal workflows that choke speed‑to‑revenue. Agents run quietly inside your website, CRM, accounting software and communication channels. Emphasise the difference between “AI features” and embedded workflows that listen, extract, structure, route and publish work automatically.
Outcomes
List the tangible benefits SMBs see in the first 30 days:
Faster launches: new product pages or campaign assets generated and approved in days instead of weeks.
4× productivity lift for small teams — owners spend more time on strategy and less on admin.
AI workflows that cost pennies to run yet free up hours.
Identified savings: the assessment surfaces at least $50K+ in annualised savings through automation (time reclaimed, fewer corrections, reduced contractor spend). This figure aligns with the types of savings found during assessments for direct selling clients and will be tailored to SMBs.

Days 4–7: quantify the impact – measure hours spent and cost of manual tasks; identify at least $50K+ in annualised savings or equivalent value.
Days 8–14: deliver the roadmap – prioritised list of AI workflows, savings model, and a 30‑day sprint plan.

5. Results
This page provides social proof. Use anonymised or hypothetical case studies that reflect typical SMB scenarios.
Each case study card should follow a consistent format:
Situation – describe the challenge (e.g., a retailer spending hours on social media posts and customer emails).
Workflows deployed – list the relevant solutions (e.g., content factory, customer service assistant, cash‑flow dashboard).
Results – include metrics: hours saved, faster turnaround, increased conversions, improved customer satisfaction. For example, small businesses using AI for customer service report faster resolution times and improved response quality

6. About
Introduce your team and philosophy.
Hero – “Built by operators for entrepreneurs.”
Story – Explain that you’ve built AI solutions across multiple industries and know how to make them work in SMB contexts. Reference that you’ve been practicing AI since the early days and have seen adoption climb from around 40 % of small businesses using AI in 2024 to almost 60 % in 2025
uschamber.com
.
Values – Practicality, measurable outcomes, and empowerment of small business owners. Note that your goal is to reduce drudge work so owners can focus on growth.
Why different – emphasise that you embed AI into existing tools rather than selling a new platform; you measure success in hours saved and revenue impacts.
CTA: Book a call.
7. Resources
Provide free tools and guides to build trust and educate visitors.
AI Readiness Quiz – host the 12‑question quiz on a subpage. Score answers to place visitors into Early Stage, Workflow Friction or ROI Ready groups. Encourage them to book an assessment based on their score.
Top 10 AI Mistakes Guide – offer a downloadable one‑pager or article outlining common errors small businesses make when adopting AI. For example: starting with tools instead of workflows, treating chatbots as a strategy, ignoring compliance, not integrating into existing systems, failing to assign owners, and scaling before proving value. Provide a CTA to download the guide and book an assessment.
Top 10 Red Flags for AI Vendors – a sharper checklist for more sophisticated readers. Warn about vendors who lead with demos, can’t tie features to KPIs, require a new portal, ignore compliance, and promise results without deployment. Link to a blog post explaining each red flag.
Conclude the Resources page with a call to action: “Turn insight into a roadmap. Book an AI assessment to identify your top workflows and savings.”
8. Governance & Safety (footer link)
Explain that all workflows include guardrails for compliance and data privacy. For SMBs, highlight that security is a top barrier to adoption: 38 % worry about data privacy and security
newsroom.paypal-corp.com
. Outline how you enforce role‑based access, audit trails and market‑specific policies.
9. Integrations & Data (footer link)
Detail the systems you integrate with: ecommerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce), CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce), accounting tools (QuickBooks, Xero), marketing platforms (Mailchimp, Klaviyo) and communication channels (Slack, Teams). Emphasise that you don’t require clients to adopt a new platform and that your agents operate within their existing stack. Mention that 60 % of U.S. small businesses say they use AI as of 2025
uschamber.com
, so integrating AI into existing tools is both feasible and common.
10. FAQ (footer link)
Address common questions:
Do we need a new platform? (No – agents embed in your current tools.)
How quickly will we see results? (Within 30 days.)
What data do you need? (The data your workflows already touch: sales reports, customer emails, marketing assets, product info.)
How is security handled? (We build guardrails and follow least‑privilege access.)
How much does it cost? (Answer ranges based on scope; emphasise ROI and assessment savings.)
What if we already have a chatbot? (You’ll learn how to turn it into a productivity engine.)
11. Design Considerations
Provide guidance to the designer and developer on aesthetics:
Colour palette – Use a clean neutral base (crisp white or off‑white) with a dark anchor like charcoal or deep navy for text and navigation. Introduce a primary accent such as electric blue or teal for calls‑to‑action, and a warm secondary accent like coral or golden yellow for highlights
thesmallbusinessexpo.com
. Ensure high contrast for readability and accessibility
cleardigital.com
.
Typography – Pair a modern sans‑serif (Inter, Montserrat, Poppins) for body text with a slightly more expressive display font for headlines. Maintain generous line spacing and clear hierarchy. Rounded fonts and soft curves align with the “bold minimalism” trend
thesmallbusinessexpo.com
.
Layout – Use a bento grid or modular layout to organise content into self‑contained sections
sltcreative.com
. Incorporate scrollytelling by revealing information as users scroll; kinetic typography can emphasise keywords
sltcreative.com
. Incorporate micro‑interactions on buttons and icons; maintain mobile‑first design and high‑contrast accessible modes
thesmallbusinessexpo.com
.
Visual tone – Professional yet approachable. Avoid cookie‑cutter templates; use subtle animations and modular grids to add personality without overwhelming visitors.
